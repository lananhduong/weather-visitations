# Impact of Weather on Visitation Analysis

- **Client**: "Stockland" - One of Australia's largest property groups owning, building, and managing shopping centres, housing estates, industrial estates, retirement villages, etc.
- **Business Problem**: Impact of weather on retail shopping centre visitation/spend.

- People visitations are a key performance indictor for retail centres, understanding the relationship between weather and visitation/spend for retail shopping centres is key to predicting future trends and changes in behavioural patterns that could impact centre performance. 

  The analysis aims to understand if there is any relationships between the two and how that typically impacts visitations and spend metrics, these could be singular weather events or elongated weather events, (I.e. heavy rain for 1 day, or consistent rain for 2 weeks).

- The dataset includes: Weather data of 8 cities (collected from outside sources), and Visitation Data (given by Stockland team).
